# CRUD artisan command for rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate

Creates a Model, Controller (with Repository, validation Requests, Events and Listeners), Migration, Routes, Breadcrumbs and CRUD Views for the given name ready to work in [rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate](https://www.github.com/rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate/) backend.

From version 1.4 you can also optionally generate frontend files: Controller, Labels, Event, Request, Listener, View, Route and Repository.

By default it does not overwrite any files that may exist with the pre-stablished names. So, if you delete one of the files and run the command again, the deleted file will be created again and the rest will be ignored and will keep the changes you could have made.

## Requires

- [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
- [rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate](https://www.github.com/rappasoft/laravel-5-boilerplate/)

It has been tested with Laravel 6.0.

## Install

```
composer require pqrs/l5b-crud
composer require laravel/helpers
```

## Run

In your Laravel project root folder:

```
php artisan l5b:crud example
```

Where _example_ is the name you want for your model (routes, views, controllers,...). I've tried to follow best naming practices and it uses plural or singular names and lower or uppercase where needed. You can also use camelCase or snake_case.

Parameters _example_, _Example_, _examples_ or _EXAMPLES_ all give the same results.

Then run the created migration:

```
php artisan migrate
```

In your browser open:

```
https://YOUR_SITE/admin/examples
```

**...et voilà! :)**

Note: out of the box, the table comes only with a _title_ text field, besides the _id_, _deleted_at_, _created_at_ and _updated_at_. Edit your newly created migration file to add any other you may need before runnning the migrate command.

## Options

You can create all the files and run the migration by running the command with the --migrate option:

```
php artisan l5b:crud example --migrate

or

php artisan l5b:crud example -m
```

You may also specify the name of the default text field 'title' to whatever other you prefer with the --field option:

```
php artisan l5b:crud example --field=name

or

php artisan l5b:crud example -f name
```

You can also overwrite previously created files with the --force option.

```
php artisan l5b:crud example --force
```

To generate the frontend files also, you should use the --frontend option.

```
php artisan l5b:crud example --frontend
```

## Include a menu item

A file named _sidebar-examples.blade.php_ is created in the folder _/resources/views/backend/example/includes_. It contains the html code for a menu item to access your recently created views. You can show it in your sidebar by including the following line in _/resources/views/backend/includes/sidebar.blade.php_ wherever you want it to appear:

```
@include('backend.example.includes.sidebar-examples')
```

## Events and Listeners

The package generates three events and listeners for creating, updating and deleting items methods. In order to get these to work you must resgister them with the event dispatcher, adding this line to your _Providers/EventServiceProvider.php_ file (under _Backend Subscribers_):

```
\App\Listeners\Backend\Example\ExampleEventListener::class
```

## Language lines

Customized English language lines can be found _/resources/lang/en_. There is a file for backend lines (backend_examples.php) and another for frontend (frontend_examples.php).
